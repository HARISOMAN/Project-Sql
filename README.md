Note: Based on the repository files, it appears you have both SQL components and a frontend integration (HTML/JS/TypeScript).

🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of SQL and frontend layers to support data-driven features on a web interface. Key aspects include:

SQL scripts for querying, data retrieval, and transformations

Integration with web UI / frontend components (TypeScript, HTML) to display data

Styling & layout using frameworks (e.g. Tailwind CSS)

Use of bundlers / build tools (Vite) to manage assets and deployment

🛠 Features & Functionality

Database Queries / Scripts — Contains queries to fetch and transform data.

Frontend UI — A web interface or dashboard to visualize SQL query results (via HTML + JS/TypeScript).

Styling — Tailwind or CSS-based styling for layout and responsiveness.

Build Configurations — Use of vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json for modern frontend development workflows.

🧑‍💻 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js & npm (for frontend)

Database / SQL engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)

Basic familiarity with TypeScript, HTML, CSS

Setup Instructions

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/HARISOMAN/Project-Sql.git
cd Project-Sql


Frontend setup

npm install
npm run dev


This will start the frontend dev server (Vite) and serve the UI interface.

SQL / Backend

Open your SQL client and run the scripts in src/ to create tables or populate sample data.

Ensure the frontend is configured to point to the appropriate database / API endpoint.

Open your browser at the local server (e.g. http://localhost:3000) to view UI + data.

📈 How It Works

The frontend UI sends requests to backend / API to fetch data (via SQL queries).

SQL scripts in src/ perform transformations, joins, aggregations.

Results are returned to the UI, which displays data in tables, charts, or dashboards.

Styling and layout handled by Tailwind CSS or similar frameworks.

🎨 Example Use Cases

Filtering data by date, region, category

Displaying charts (bar / line / pie) of aggregated SQL results

Pagination or search for large datasets

Responsive UI for both desktop and mobile views

📚 Technologies & Skills Used

SQL: Complex queries, joins, aggregations

TypeScript / JavaScript: Frontend logic

HTML / CSS / Tailwind: Layout and styling

Vite: Modern bundler and dev server

Frontend-Backend Integration

🛠 Customization & Next Steps

You can extend this project by:

Adding API / backend (Node.js / Express / Flask / Django) to serve data securely

Integrating Power BI / dashboards for richer analytics

Adding authentication, role-based views, and user input filters

Deploying the full stack to a cloud service (AWS, Azure, etc.)
